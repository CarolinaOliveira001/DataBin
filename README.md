## Description of the package

This package contains three different datasets: wildfire, windspeed and earthquake.
However more datasets will be added in the future. For now, these datasets were
part of my master thesis and can be used for reproducibility purposes.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank two people who made this package possible by sending me the
cleaned dataset.
